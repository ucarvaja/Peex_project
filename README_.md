### Docker file

Dockerfile uses multistage to reduce image weight.    
Node as base image.   
Ngnix as server.   
file default.conf -> redirects requests to index.html.   
Default container port: 80.   
Dockefile reference : CMD.   
To create multi OS images requires docker [buildx](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/) before pushing images to the registry. 

- Note:
    - The dog breed app that is deployed was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
